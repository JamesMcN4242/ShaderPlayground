# ShaderPlayground
A simplistic playground Unity project I'll be using to experiment with some HLSL shaders in a blank project.

The idea is that a lot of these shaders will be based of (or follow) the tutorials available at [ronja-tutorials](https://www.ronja-tutorials.com/). 
From there I'd like to play with and adapt them to get a better understanding and concept of how the shaders can be manipulated.
